# ðŸ’“ Heart Disease Prediction App

An interactive dashboard built with Streamlit that uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Random Forest model for prediction
- ROC curve visualization
- Feature importance chart
- Model comparison (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression)
- Manual and random patient testing
- Clean interface with expandable sections

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The app uses a dataset of patient health metrics to train multiple machine learning models. Users can test predictions either by entering patient data manually or by selecting a random patient from the test set.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
